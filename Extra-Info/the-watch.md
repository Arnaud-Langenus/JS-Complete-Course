# The watch

The watch is a moment of 10 to 15 minutes, each day after the break, where the junior gives a presentation or live code demo about anything tech related.
Possible subjects are Tech news, programming languages, how to manage a server, ...

When in doubt if something is suitable for the Watch, feel free to ask your coach.

# Order of the watch

Always be prepared for the next 3 watches.
This means that if you have a watch on Wednesday, you should be able to give your talk on Monday.

A failure of all 3 juniors to give a watch will lead to collective homework!

# Tips

## Practice
* Practice with the beamer at least once
* Practice what you are going to say at least once, preferably with someone listening

## Slides/other media
* Use the pointer device so you can advance slides without being at your laptop

## Ask questions
* As introduction to new things: 'what do you know about X?'
* To keep people interested: 'but why would they do X like this?'
* To know if they are getting what you are saying: 'Which of these is correct?'
* Write down those questions and think of the possible responses
  - What if the audience doesnâ€™t know what to answer? Guide them or drop it?

## Content
* Make a long presentation, then cut stuff that is bad/boring
